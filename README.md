# NCSU--Multi-User-Scheduling-System
PackScheduler is a course registration system for a university, similar to the system in MyPackPortal that you use to register for your classes. Youâ€™ll work on implementing a system that provides the functionality for admitted students to register for courses that are taught by faculty. The courses will have enrollment caps and waitlists.
